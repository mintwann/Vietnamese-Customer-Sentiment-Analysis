# Sentiment Analysis of Vietnamese Customer Reviews

## Description
This project aimed to develop a sentiment analysis model to classify customer reviews of phone products sold by Dien May Xanh (a leading electronics retailer in Vietnam). This project was completed as part of data science coursework and allowed me to gain practical experience in data collection, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning using Python. 

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:**  I scraped approximately 5,000 customer reviews on phone products from Dien May Xanh website using Selenium and Python. 
2. **Preprocessing:**  Cleaned and transformed the raw text data using Python's Pandas library to prepare it for analysis.
3. **Model Building:**  I trained and evaluated a Logistic Regression model with L2 regularization for sentiment classification using scikit-learn.
4. **Evaluation:**  The model achieved an accuracy of 88% in predicting customer sentiment.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Selenium, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Hugging Face Models
- Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 pro)

## Key Takeaways
This project deepened my understanding of NLP techniques and provided valuable experience in building end-to-end machine learning pipelines. It reinforced my strong interest in further developing my Python skills and exploring related applications in fields such as web scraping, data analysis, and machine learning.
